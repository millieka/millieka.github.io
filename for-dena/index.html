        <h1>HI DENAAA 🎉</h1>
        <p>First of all, I wish you a very happy birthday as it is at hand on 29<sup>th</sup> of July. I'm a Julian too
          by the way
          (someone who is born in July) 🎈😁
        </p>
        <p>Another year older means another year <b>wiser</b>, <b>smarter</b> and also, in YOUR case, <b>prettier</b>
          :)))
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <div>
            Umm, have you ever thought that <b>life</b> would be like this when you were only a little kid? 👧
          </div>
          <div>
            Have you ever looked back and ponder what <b>life</b> would be like if you drifted away from your current
            path and
            made a new entire one? Would it be better? Have you got any regrets? 🎭
          </div>
          <div>
            What if you had another whole new <b>friends</b> and <b>family</b> and we were not cousins? Would it make
            any difference?
            🤔
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>Now you might be saying
          <blockquote>
            <i>“oh yeah that'd be much better if we were not relatives. I mean what the heck are
              these questions and what's your point!”</i> 😹
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>Well, you know, <b>I don't know you that much</b> since we are living on different soils and never met face
          to face.
          But that doesn't mean I don't want to… I really would have loved to get to know you if I had a chance. It's
          not that late though. You are my cousin by the way and just a really kind, caring, and lovely one.</p>
        <p>You may not be aware of that, but <b>you touched my heart</b> at some points remotely when I felt so lonely.
          Thing
          that you might be thinking of as even not being a big deal, like wishing a happy birthday. Over these years
          you've been trying to connect and I've been just negligent, I guess. Sorry for that. It's not gonna justify me
          saying that I've been having a rough life in as far as not knowing even who I am!</p>
        <p>So, this is what it is. Just doing something personalized for you. I really needed to do something to return
          your favors and also get in touch with you. You and your mom have been always courteous to us. <b>Thank
            you</b> 💗
        </p>

        <h1>The Intersection of Our Lives</h1>
        <p>Just to check what we know about each other, I am about to reminisce about <b>the past</b>. Life stories that
          is
          related to
          you, your mom, my family and of course myself 📌
        </p>
        <p><b>1️⃣ EARLY YEARS</b></p>
        <p>This is YOU (Duh)! Look how cute you were 😊</p>
        <div class="row text-center mb-3">
          <div class="col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-7 col-sm-8 col-9 mx-auto">
            <img class="img-500" src="./g-m-i/1.min-min.png" loading="lazy" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This picture was taken and background-removed from the original image that was a printed photo. I don't know
          how, but <b>my mother</b> had it on our <b>family</b> album. Looks like <b>your mom</b> gave it to my mother
          many years ago.
        </p>
        <p>I cannot recall those times that much. I can remember of some blurry images from your mom when I was 6. She
          used to say the word “<b>Okay</b>” way too much and I tried to imitate her. So ever since I heard that word
          from
          auntie, I'd been repeating “Okay” over and over and somewhat it became my pet phrase 🆗
        </p>
        <p>As she was a <b>hairdresser</b>, she wanted to cut our hair every time she came back to Iran :)))</p>
        <br />
        <p>I can remember of a vacation going alongside your mother to <b>Isfahan</b> city, the city where your mom's
          mother and her aunts have been living for a long time.</p>
        <div class="row text-center mb-3">

        </div>
        <p>The photo above was taken on that trip where we were paddling a boat on a lake. The little person on the left
          is me and the boy on the right is <b>my brother</b>, Soheil. <b>My father</b> took this picture.
        </p>
        <p>Uh Another one… Long time ago, <b>your mom</b> brought a <b>video camera</b> for us a souvenir that was huge
          in size. Ever
          since that, <b>my dad</b> has been in love with that.
        </p>
        <p>This is a screenshot of a video captured by that camera:</p>

        <p>This is a picture from 2014, I guess. It's been taken by me in a restaurant where we all gathered as a
          family. All your uncles and cousins except uncle Ahmad's children and wife as they got apart earlier.
        </p>
        <p>Let's see some pictures!</p>

        <p>Though I've almost never been in the photos since I was the photographer, I have some pictures that I'm in it
          too. That time taking selfie was not trending that much. At least in our country :)))

        <p>Truth be told, I just don't remember much of that. Cannot feel it… The <b>past</b>. Feeling like I never
          existed and
          these are someone else's recollection. But look at me. I somehow managed to find some related memories to
          share with you 😊🍕
